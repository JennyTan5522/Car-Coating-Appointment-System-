This is a JAVA console-based car coating reservation and payment system using OOP concepts.

The proposed system known as ‘Online Car Coating Booking System’ allows customers to make reservations / booking online for car
coating. Customers will be able to view their profile and add new cars into their profile. If the car information customers add into their profile is
wrong, customers will be able to edit their car information such as editing the number plate, car owner name, etc. If there are any cars that
customers want to remove, customers can use the delete car function to delete their car from their profile.
